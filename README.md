USE OF AI ASSISTANCE

This project made use of AI tools to support development. Specifically, we used Vercel's v0 for the following tasks:

- Standardizing naming conventions and removing unnecessary spaces in our code
- Debugging issues related to file connections and imports
- Assisting in turning code into reusable components (OOP)
- Generating mock images as placeholders for sample data

Disclaimer: The skeletal code and backbone of the project logic were provided by our team. AI assistance was used only as a supportive tool, and all final decisions, implementations, and validations were made by the team.
